**Space Game**

This was a simple pygame project made for our uni GameJam.

- Player can control the rocket using the arrow keys and must navigate around asteroids to survive.
- Player can collect power ups or downs that will either shrink, grow or shield the rocket. 
- Each level up is marked by the passing of a different planet in the background.

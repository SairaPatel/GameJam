**Space Game**

## Background and Overview ##

This was a simple pygame project that I made with a partner for our Uni's Game Jam. We were given 2 weeks to come up with a game to present.
We wanted to choose a simple and fun arcade-style game so we decided on this space theme. 

This project is made in python using pygame. To run it, make sure pygame is installed and then run main.py


## About ##

On the home screen, the user has the option to choose a rocketship. 

### Gameplay ## 
- The user can control the rocket using the arrow keys
- The rocket must avoid asteroids and can pick up power ups/downs.
- Each time the rocket passes a planet, they are passing a checkpoint.
- When the player dies they can choose to start again at earth (checkpoint 1) or to continue from the last passed planet/checkpoint

The user's score is the number of meters they travel before dying. As a player flies higher, their speed increases.

## Reflection ##
The toughest part of this project was coming up with an idea for a game. I have some experience in programming games however they have usually been clones or based on another game. 
It definetely took a lot of time and discussion before we settled on even the general concept of the game. Once we had a rough idea, we had quite a lot of ideas between us for possible features. 
This was one of my first times properly working together with someone on a whole project and it was a great experience to be able to discuss and design ideas with another programmer. 

## Future ##
We came up with a few aspirational ideas of features which we didn't have time for in the 2 weeks period:
- Player can collect stars during gameplay and then buy rockets with it on the home screen
- Add a little animation of the rocket flying up and landing on a planet as a break at each checkpoint, rather than seeing it the planets in the background and continuously flying.
- Add missiles that can be bought or as powerups that the player can shoot to destroy an asteroid ahead.
